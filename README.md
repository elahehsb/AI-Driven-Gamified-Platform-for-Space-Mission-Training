# AI-Driven-Gamified-Platform-for-Space-Mission-Training


### Project Overview
This project proposes the development of an innovative gamified platform designed to train astronauts and mission control teams in handling space mission scenarios. The platform will combine elements of virtual space missions and educational escape rooms to simulate critical incidents such as spacecraft malfunctions, spacewalk emergencies, and unexpected cosmic events.

Participants will interact with a virtual environment replicating a space mission, where they must work collaboratively to solve problems and make decisions under pressure. The platform will collect multimodal data from participants, including physiological data (e.g., heart rate, stress levels), decision-making logs, and real-time communication analysis. This data will be analyzed using advanced temporal learning analytics and explainable AI methods to map the decision-making process and identify key factors that contribute to successful and effective mission management.

This project sits at the intersection of space exploration, computing, education, psychology, and AI, offering a unique opportunity to contribute to the development of tools that enhance the preparedness of space missions.

### Project Goals
1. Interactive Space Mission Simulations: Develop an immersive virtual environment that simulates space mission scenarios, enabling participants to practice crisis management strategies in space.
2. Multimodal Data Collection: Integrate physiological sensors, decision-making logs, and communication analysis to gather comprehensive data on participant responses during simulations.
3. Temporal Learning Analytics: Apply temporal learning analytics to analyze the decision-making process over time, identifying patterns and critical decision points.
4. Explainable AI: Use explainable AI techniques to provide feedback on the decision-making process, helping participants understand the impact of their actions.
5. Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Combine knowledge from space exploration, psychology, AI, and education to create a comprehensive training platform.

### Project Structure
The project is divided into several modules, each focusing on different aspects of the system:

1. space_mission_scenario_generator.py: Creates and manages the virtual space mission scenarios.
2. multimodal_data_collection.py: Manages the collection of multimodal data from participants.
3. temporal_learning_analysis.py: Analyzes the decision-making process using temporal learning analytics.
4. explainable_ai_feedback.py: Provides explainable AI feedback to participants based on their decisions.
5. user_interface.py: An interactive interface for participants to engage with the platform and receive feedback.
